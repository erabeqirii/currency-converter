## Currency Converter
This project is a Currency Converter application built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to allow users to convert currency values from one type to another by fetching real-time exchange rates from an external API.

## Features:
Real-Time Conversion: The application uses the ExchangeRate-API to fetch the latest currency exchange rates.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Bootstrap, the layout is responsive and easy to navigate.
Select Currency: Users can select currencies from two dropdown lists, one for the base currency and one for the target currency.
Instant Calculation: The converted amount is calculated instantly when the user enters a value and clicks the "Convert" button.
Reset Functionality: A "Reset" button is available to clear the input fields and reset the form.
## How it works:
The user inputs the amount to be converted.
The user selects the base currency (the currency from which they want to convert).
The user selects the target currency (the currency to which they want to convert).
Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the application fetches the latest exchange rates from the API, calculates the conversion, and displays the result.
The "Reset" button reloads the page and clears all the input values.
## Technologies Used:
HTML5: Provides the structure of the web page.
CSS3: Used for styling and layout.
Bootstrap: Provides responsive design and pre-built UI components.
JavaScript (ES6): Handles the logic for fetching API data, performing the conversion calculations, and updating the UI dynamically.
